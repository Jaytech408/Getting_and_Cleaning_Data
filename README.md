# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This project includes a script called run_analysis.R which is used with a dataset.

Download and extract the archive to a folder named data. You can then execute the run_analysis.R on that dataset which will output the results to a text file named tidyagg.txt.
